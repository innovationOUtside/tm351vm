# set permissions on a directory
# after any installation, if a directory needs to be (human) user-writable,
# run this script on it.
# It will make everything in the directory owned by the group $NB_GID
# and writable by that group.
# Deployments that want to set a specific user id can preserve permissions
# by adding the `--group-add users` line to `docker run`.

# uses find to avoid touching files that already have the right permissions,
# which would cause massive image explosion

# right permissions are:
# group=$NB_GID
# AND permissions include group rwX (directory-execute)
# AND directories have setuid,setgid bits set


#Explicity set group id to 100 for now - should be an env var
